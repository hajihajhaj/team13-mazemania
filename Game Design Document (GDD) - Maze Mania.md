## 2. Gameplay Overview 

The game is a split-screen co-operative maze game where two players must work together to navigate mazes, solve puzzles, and avoid traps. Each player can only see certain parts of the other player’s maze and they need to communicate to guide each other through. 

  

**Core Gameplay Loop:**   

- **Navigate**: Each player moves through their own maze discovering traps and puzzles that the other player needs help with. 

- **Communicate**: Players share clues and directions to avoid traps or solve puzzles. 

- **Solve Puzzles**: Players work together to overcome obstacles and reach the finish line before the time runs out. 

- **Progress**: The game ends successfully when both players reach the finish line. If the timer runs out, they lose and must restart.

## 3. Game Objectives 

**Primary Objective:**   

Players must reach the end of the maze together, using communication and teamwork to overcome traps and puzzles within a time limit. 

  

**Objective Question:**   

"How effectively can players handle teamwork and communication under time pressure?"

## 4. Player Objectives (Prototype Focus) 

The prototype will aim to answer the following question:  

"How does restricting player visibility to only certain parts of the maze impact teamwork and communication?"

**Challenges Requiring Communication:**   

- Navigating traps that only one player can see while the other player is unaware.

- Solving puzzles, where one player has the clue and the other faces the puzzle. 

- Coordinating actions for time-sensitive challenges, requiring precise timing and clear instructions.

## 5. Puzzle and Trap System 

### Color Code Doors 

- **Clue Location**: In Player 1’s maze, place a green light as the clue. 

- **Puzzle Location**: In Player 2’s maze, add three doors (green, orange, purple). 

- **Mechanic**: Player 1 tells Player 2 the correct color (green). If Player 2 touches the wrong door, they die and return to the maze start. 

  

### Timed Trap Door 

- **Clue Location**: Not needed (direct action puzzle). 

- **Puzzle Location**: In Player 2’s maze, place a button. 

- **Mechanic**: Player 2 presses the button to open a door in Player 1’s maze temporarily. Player 1 must quickly move through before it closes. If they don’t make it, Player 2 must press the button again. 

  

### Laser Grid Puzzle 

- **Clue Location**: In Player 1’s maze, display the sequence Left-Up-Right as a clue. 

- **Puzzle Location**: In Player 2’s maze, set up a laser grid with buttons. 

- **Mechanic**: Player 2 enters the correct sequence to deactivate the lasers. Entering the wrong sequence keeps the laser active, and Player 2 must try again.

## 6. Communication and Navigation Mechanics 

**Restricted Visibility**: Each player can only see certain traps and paths in the other player’s maze, requiring them to communicate to navigate effectively. 

**Challenges:**   

- Players must solve puzzles that depend on information only one player has.

- Players must trust each other’s guidance when they can’t see certain hazards.

 

**Timer**:   

The game has a time limit to complete the maze, creating urgency and pressure for quick communication. 

**Expected Duration:**   

- A single session is expected to last 60 seconds, making it a quick and requires fast thinking and communication.

## 7. Player Experience Goals 

We want players to feel the rush of navigating the maze under a time limit and the excitement of working with a friend to succeed. The game is designed to be fast-paced and fun, creating a strong sense of teamwork and shared victory. 

**Outcomes:**   

- **Success**: Both players reach the end of the maze before time runs out, resulting in a win.
  
- **Failure**: The timer runs out, resulting in a restart.

## 8. Tools and Platforms

**Development Platform:**

The prototype will be built using Unity.

**Tools:**   

- **Unity Engine**: For game development and prototyping.
  
- **GitHub**:  For version control and team collaboration.

- **Slack**:  For task management and tracking progress

  **Ideal Platform:**

Maze Mania is designed primarily for an arcade cabinet taking advantage of the split-screen setup and physical controls for a classic in-person cooperative experience. However, the game could also be adapted for PC in the future.

## 9. Conclusion 

Maze Mania is designed to test and enhance teamwork, communication, and memory. The primary mechanic being examined in the prototype is the restricted visibility and how it impacts player engagement and communication under time pressure.
